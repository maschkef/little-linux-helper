# config/general.conf (legacy aggregate)
#
# As of v0.6, Little Linux Helper stores general configuration in
# config/general.d/*.conf fragments. This file is intentionally kept minimal so
# that older installations continue to work and advanced users can provide
# temporary overrides. To override a value, add KEY="value" assignments below –
# they will run *after* the fragments have been sourced.
#
# Example override (uncomment to force German regardless of fragment value):
# CFG_LH_LANG="de"
