# CFG_LH_BACKUP_ROOT:
# The absolute path to the root directory where backups should be stored.
# Example: "/mnt/external_drive" or "/srv/backups"
CFG_LH_BACKUP_ROOT="/run/media/tux/hdd_3tb/"

# CFG_LH_BACKUP_DIR:
# The name of the subdirectory within CFG_LH_BACKUP_ROOT where the actual backup data will be stored.
# Must start with "/". Example: "/my_system_backup"
CFG_LH_BACKUP_DIR="/backups"

# CFG_LH_TEMP_SNAPSHOT_DIR:
# An absolute path to a temporary directory used for BTRFS snapshots during the backup process.
# This directory should be on a BTRFS volume, ideally on the system itself if possible.
# IMPORTANT: Do NOT use Snapper (.snapshots) or Timeshift directories to avoid conflicts.
CFG_LH_TEMP_SNAPSHOT_DIR="/.snapshots_lh_temp"

# CFG_LH_RETENTION_BACKUP:
# The number of backup versions to keep (e.g., 10 means the 10 newest backups will be retained).
CFG_LH_RETENTION_BACKUP="10"

# CFG_LH_BACKUP_LOG_BASENAME:
# The base name for backup log files. A timestamp (YYMMDD-HHMM_) will be prepended to this name.
# Example: "backup.log" becomes "240730-1015_backup.log".
CFG_LH_BACKUP_LOG_BASENAME="backup.log"

# CFG_LH_TAR_EXCLUDES:
# Exclusion patterns for TAR-based backups (space-separated list).
# Example: "*.tmp *.log /var/cache"
CFG_LH_TAR_EXCLUDES=""

# CFG_LH_DEBUG_LOG_LIMIT:
# Maximum number of backup candidates to show in debug logs when listing existing backups.
# Set to 0 for unlimited (shows all existing backups in debug output).
# This only affects log verbosity, not backup functionality.
# Recommended: 10-20 for normal use, 0 for debugging issues.
CFG_LH_DEBUG_LOG_LIMIT="10"

# CFG_LH_KEEP_SOURCE_SNAPSHOTS:
# Controls whether source snapshots created by this script should be preserved after backup.
# Values: "prompt" (ask user during backup), "true" (always keep), "false" (always delete)
# When kept, snapshots are stored in CFG_LH_SOURCE_SNAPSHOT_DIR to avoid conflicts with other tools.
CFG_LH_KEEP_SOURCE_SNAPSHOTS="prompt"

# CFG_LH_SOURCE_SNAPSHOT_DIR:
# Directory for permanent source snapshots when CFG_LH_KEEP_SOURCE_SNAPSHOTS is enabled.
# This avoids conflicts with Snapper (/.snapshots) and Timeshift directories.
# Script-created snapshots are marked with metadata for identification and cleanup.
CFG_LH_SOURCE_SNAPSHOT_DIR="/.snapshots_lh"
