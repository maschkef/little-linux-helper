# config/backup.conf (legacy aggregate)
#
# Backup settings now reside in config/backup.d/*.conf fragments. This file is
# retained for tooling that still expects a monolithic configuration. Add
# override assignments below if you need to force a value after the fragments
# have been loaded.
#
# Example override (set custom backup root):
# CFG_LH_BACKUP_ROOT="/srv/backups"
