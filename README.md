## Description

Little Linux Helper is a collection of Bash scripts designed to simplify various system administration, diagnostic, and maintenance tasks on Linux. It provides a menu-driven interface for easy access to a variety of tools and functions.

More detailed technical English documentation for individual modules and core components can be found in the `docs` directory. This documentation was created in part to provide AI with the context of a module or file without having to read it completely and to save context.
The `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` contains all the information about `lib/lib_common.sh` and `help_master.sh` needed to create a new module.
Note: The original `lib_common.sh` has been split into multiple specialized libraries for better organization (e.g., `lib_colors.sh`, `lib_i18n.sh`, `lib_notifications.sh`, etc.), but `lib_common.sh` remains the main entry point and automatically loads all other core libraries. Additionally, `lib_btrfs.sh` is a specialized library used exclusively by BTRFS modules and is not part of the core library system.

My environment is typically Arch (main system) or Debian (various services on my Proxmox - hence the Docker components), so there may be unknown issues on other distributions, although I try to keep everything compatible.

<summary>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Usage Notes</summary>

**Please carefully consider the following points before using the scripts from this repository:**

* **Not a professional programmer:** I'm not actually a programmer. These scripts were created as a hobby project and for simplification. They may therefore contain suboptimal approaches, errors, or inefficient methods.
* **Use at your own risk:** The use of the scripts provided here is entirely at your own risk. I assume no responsibility or liability for possible data loss, system instabilities, damage to hardware or software, or any other direct or indirect consequences that could result from using these scripts. It is strongly recommended to always create backups of your important data and system before performing critical operations.
* **AI-generated content:** A significant portion of the scripts and accompanying documentation was created with the assistance of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although I have endeavored to test the functionality and verify the information, the scripts may contain errors, unexpected behavior, or logical flaws attributable to the AI generation process. Be aware of this circumstance and critically review the code before deploying it, especially in production or sensitive environments.

## Internationalization

<details>
<summary>üåç Multi-language Support</summary>

Little Linux Helper supports multiple languages for the user interface. The internationalization system enables a consistent and user-friendly experience in different languages.

**Supported Languages:**
* **German (de)**: Full translation support for all modules
* **English (en)**: Full translation support for all modules (default language and fallback)
* **Spanish (es)**: Only scattered internal translations (log entries, etc.), practically unusable
* **French (fr)**: Only scattered internal translations (log entries, etc.), practically unusable

**Language Selection:**
* **Automatic Detection**: The system automatically detects the system language based on environment variables (`LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `LC_MESSAGES`)
* **Manual Configuration**: The language can be set in the `config/general.conf` file with the `CFG_LH_LANG` setting
* **Fallback Mechanism**: For missing translations or unsupported languages, the system automatically falls back to English

**Language Configuration:**
```bash
# In config/general.conf
CFG_LH_LANG="auto"    # Automatic system language detection
CFG_LH_LANG="de"      # German
CFG_LH_LANG="en"      # English
CFG_LH_LANG="es"      # Spanish (practically unusable, only internal messages)
CFG_LH_LANG="fr"      # French (practically unusable, only internal messages)
```

**Technical Details:**
* All user texts are retrieved through the `lh_msg()` system
* Translation files are located in the `lang/` directory, organized by language codes
* The system first loads English as a fallback base and then overwrites with the desired language
* Missing translation keys are automatically logged and displayed as `[KEY]`

</details>

## Requirements

<details>
<summary>üìã Requirements</summary>

* Bash shell
* Standard Linux utilities (such as `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `find`, `df`, `lsblk`, `ip`, `ps`, `free`, `tar`, `rsync`, `btrfs-progs`, etc.)
* Some functions may require root privileges and will use `sudo` if necessary.
* For specific functions, additional packages are required that the script will attempt to install as needed:
    * `btrfs-progs` (for BTRFS backup/restore)
    * `rsync` (for RSYNC backup/restore)
    * `smartmontools` (for S.M.A.R.T. values and disk health status)
    * `lsof` (for file access checking)
    * `hdparm` (for disk speed testing)
    * `ncdu` (for interactive disk analysis, optional)
    * `util-linux` (contains `fsck`)
    * `iproute2` (contains `ss`)
    * `rkhunter` (for rootkit checking)
    * `chkrootkit` (optional, for additional rootkit checking)
    * `lm-sensors` (for temperature and sensor values)
    * `nmap` (optional, for local port scanning)
    * **Desktop notifications:** `libnotify` (provides `notify-send`), `zenity`, or `kdialog`.
    * Python 3 (typically as `python` or `python3` command; for advanced log analysis)
    * `pacman-contrib` (for `paccache` on Arch-based systems, if not available)
    * `expac` (for recently installed packages on Arch-based systems)

The script attempts to automatically detect the package manager in use (pacman, yay, apt, dnf). It also recognizes alternative package managers like Flatpak, Snap, Nix, and AppImage.

## Installation & Setup

<details>
<summary>üöÄ Installation & Setup</summary>

1. Clone the repository or download the scripts.
2. Make sure the main script `help_master.sh` is executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x help_master.sh
    ```

</details>

## Configuration

<details>
<summary>‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Files</summary>

Little Linux Helper uses configuration files to customize certain aspects of its behavior. These files are located in the `config/` directory.

When the main script (`help_master.sh`) is started for the first time, default configuration files are automatically created if they don't already exist. This is done by copying template files with the `.example` extension (e.g., `backup.conf.example`) to their active counterparts without the suffix (e.g., `backup.conf`).

**Important:** You will be notified when a configuration file is first created. It is recommended to review these newly created `.conf` files and adapt them to your specific needs if necessary.

Configuration files are currently used for the following modules:
* **General Settings (`help_master.sh`)**: Language, logging behavior, and other basic settings (`config/general.conf`).
* **Backup & Restore (`modules/backup/mod_backup.sh`, `modules/backup/mod_btrfs_backup.sh`, `modules/backup/mod_btrfs_restore.sh`)**: Settings for backup paths, retention policies, etc. (`config/backup.conf`).
* **Docker Security Check (`mod_security.sh`)**: Settings for search paths, warnings to skip, etc. (`config/docker.conf`).

</details>

## Module Overview

<details>
<summary>üì¶ Module Overview</summary>

The project is divided into modules to organize functionality:

* **`lib/lib_common.sh`**: The heart of the project. Contains central functions used by all modules such as:
    * A unified logging system.
    * Functions for command checking and automatic dependency installation.
    * Standardized user interactions (yes/no questions, input prompts).
    * Detection of system components (package managers, etc.).
    * Management of colored terminal output for better readability.
    * Complex logic for determining the active desktop user.
    * The ability to send **desktop notifications** to the user.
    * **Core Library System**: Automatically loads specialized library components (`lib_colors.sh`, `lib_i18n.sh`, `lib_ui.sh`, etc.).

</details>

## Logging

<details>
<summary>üìú Logging</summary>

All actions are logged to help with tracking and troubleshooting.

* **Location:** Log files are created in the `logs` subdirectory within the project directory. A separate subfolder is created for each month (e.g., `logs/2025-06`).
* **Filenames:** General log files receive a timestamp indicating when the script was started. Backup and restore-specific logs are also timestamped to capture each session separately.
